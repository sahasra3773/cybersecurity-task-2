Phishing Report - Task 2

Phishing Indicators Identified:

1. Spoofed Email Address:
   - From: support@paypa1.com
   - 'paypa1.com' is a fake domain mimicking 'paypal.com' using the number '1' instead of 'l'.

2. Threatening Language:
   - Subject: "URGENT: Account Access Suspended"
   - Phrases like "Failure to verify within 24 hours..." create urgency and fear.

3. Suspicious Link:
   - https://paypal-secure.com/login
   - This is NOT an official PayPal domain.

4. Malicious Attachment:
   - Attached file: verify_account.exe
   - Executable attachments are a red flag for malware/phishing.

5. Generic Greeting:
   - "Dear Customer" instead of user's real name.

6. Grammar and Tone:
   - Robotic tone and minor inconsistencies indicate non-professional communication.

7. Social Engineering:
   - The email uses fear (account suspension) and urgency to manipulate the reader's response.

Conclusion:
This email displays multiple phishing traits and should be flagged as a phishing attempt.
